# Harvard's Courses on Programming

This is my personal progress on Harvard's series of software programming courses, known as CS50. 

To date, I've completed two courses, [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) and [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (CS50W)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/course/).

Every assignment project of each course sits on its own branch, as specified below.

### CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50)

Branches that start with `cs50`.

These projects are small and medium exercises, implemented in a range of languagues (**C** and **Python**).

### CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (CS50W)

Branches that start with `cs50/web`.

There are three projects which mostly deal with Python on the back-end and a little JavaScript on the front-end. This course dives deeper into SQL and Python's back-end frameworks such as Flask and Django.
